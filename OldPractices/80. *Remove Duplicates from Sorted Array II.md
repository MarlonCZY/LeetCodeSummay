## *80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

**Need big attention**: cannot be figure out and solution is hard to understand. need to revisit this one

### Python Solution
Every time the i pointer stay at the position where the value need to be changed. 
```Python
def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
    i = 0
    for n in nums:
        if i < 2 or n > nums[i-2]:
            nums[i] = n
            i += 1
    return i
```
