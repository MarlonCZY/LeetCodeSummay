## 347. Top K Frequent Elements

### Solution (heap)
1. counter frequency of each unique value
2. create a min heap and insert each (frequency, unique value) into heap. if size > k, pop out. Therefore, you only have top k frequent values in the heap. 
3. extract the unique values in the heap and return

```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        counter = Counter(nums)
        heap = []
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        for key, freq in counter.items():
            heapq.heappush(heap, (freq, key))
            if len(heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
        return [ele[1] for ele in heap]
```
