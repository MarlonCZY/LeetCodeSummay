## 541. Reverse String II

### Description
Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

### Example
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"

### Solution 1: a direct way
1. convert string into list so we can manipulate and assign value to each element
2. apply a for loop to walk through the list with the step size as 2k
3. in the for loop, check the special condition when there is no enough k number of elements.
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        list_s = list(s)
        start = 0
        end = 0
        for i in range(0, len(list_s), 2*k):
            start = i
            if len(list_s) - i < k:
                end = len(list_s) - 1
            else:
                end = i + k - 1
            while start < end:
                list_s[start], list_s[end] = list_s[end], list_s[start]
                start += 1
                end -= 1
        return "".join(list_s)
```
