## 53. Maximum Subarray

### Solution 1: Greedy
Idea: if we meet any negative number or current sub-array's sum is negative, we should reset the sum and start a new sequence for making the max sub-array. The reason is that any negative sum of sub-array[a:b] will make its sum of [a:b+1] smaller. 

Tip: make sure to also count single negative number as a sum and compare it with current sum.

```Python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_sum = nums[0]
        cur_sum = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if cur_sum < 0: # we are skipping negative number and any sum of numbers which are negative
                cur_sum = 0
            cur_sum += nums[i]
            
            if cur_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = cur_sum
            
        return max_sum
```
